# [SDF02] Challenge: CS Cat HTML Portfolio ðŸ˜¼

Welcome to my second challenge with CodeSpace. Please, feel welcome to browse the files created as they are very adorable and do showcase base understanding with working with HTML and CSS. In this repository, you will find an images folder as they are image source references for the html file, an html file with an adorable website and a CSS file to add style and efficient code in combination with HTML. Have fun!
